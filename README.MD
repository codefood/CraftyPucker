CraftyPucker
===========

CraftyPucker is designed to work with a NHL GameCentre account to allow people in foreign countries to watch NHL games without having  to go through the TERRIBLE AND AWFUL UI provided by GameCenter, and allowing the user to actually select their quality settings instead of them being auto-negotiated.

# Setup
You will need:
* .NET Framework
* VLC installed
* Me to finish updating this for the 2016-17 season (sorry)
